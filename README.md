Data. Together. Let's read about it
====

Data Together's reading group is a set of six conversations on themes relevant to information and ethics.
Curated reading selections are distributed once a month; we meet to discuss on video call.

# Summer - Fall 2018 Data Together Reading Group

📅 15:30-17:00 ET Tuesdays [**Data Together Calendar**](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=u75o4fbnv59006peo07nv67vsg%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FToronto)  
🎯 Participation link (recorded): [https://edgi-video-call-landing-page.herokuapp.com/https://zoom.us/j/847315566](https://edgi-video-call-landing-page.herokuapp.com/https://zoom.us/j/847315566)  
▶️ [**Data Together Call Playlist**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtsP3g9LafVul1gCctMYGm9sz5FUWr5bu)

We want to understand better just what it is that we're doing! The goal of this "syllabus" is to identify some themes that drive Data Together as a project & as a politics, and to find some readings that help us understand those themes better.

Once a month on **Tuesday afternoon** we'll host a 1.5 hour discussion of one of [six themes](#themes) over summer 2018. Everyone should try hard to read the *core* reading (~30 pages), and once or twice sign up to [facilitate discussion](#facilitation).

From this initial iteration, our hope is that: first, we learn together!; second, through documenting discussion we can articulate Data Together principles.

## Sessions

### A view on the decentralized (distributed) web

Just getting us all on the same page about this very, err... central question, and also working through distinctions between similar terms (especially) decentralized, distributed, federated, p2p.

**Readings**:

- Brewster Kahle (2015) ["Locking the Web Open, a Call for a Distributed Web"](http://brewster.kahle.org/2015/04/22/locking-the-web-open-a-call-for-a-distributed-web/)

### Ownership

Sometimes when we talk about Data Together we use phrases like "communities taking ownership of their data". What do we mean, and why is this language important to us?

How should we think about "ownership" as a value, and in what ways are individual and collective ownership different from each other?

**Readings**:

- Selections from [_Ours to Hack and to Own_](http://www.orbooks.com/catalog/ours-to-hack-and-to-own/) (2016) edited by Trebor Scholz and Nathan Schneider ([WorldCat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/ours-to-hack-and-to-own-the-rise-of-platform-cooperativism-a-new-vision-for-the-future-of-work-and-a-fairer-internet/oclc/1044840227))

### Commons

Sometimes, instead of ownership, we talk about a "commons". How ought the commons to be governed, and by whom?

**Readings**:

### Centralization vs. Decentralization (and Peer-to-peer, Federation)

Now that we've thought more about possession and ownership let's return to thinking about just how decentralization differs from centralizations (and whether or how peer-to-peer or federation fit in)!

**Readings**:

- Nathan Schneider (2017) "The Irresistible Power of Decentralization"—and Its Elusiveness (DRAFT--not for circulation)
- Executive Summary (6 pages) of [Defending Internet Freedom through Decentralization: Back to the Future?](https://dci.mit.edu/research/the-decentralized-web)

-  _See also_: P2P Foundation wiki entry on [Peer_to_Peer](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Peer_to_Peer)

### Privacy

Lately we've been hearing some interesting critiques of "privacy as a concept and moral imperative". Let's see if we think they make sense.

**Readings**:

- Selections from Wendy Hui Kyong Chun (2016) [_Updating to Remain the Same: Habitual New Media_](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/updating-remain-same) **focus on Part II Introduction and end of Chapter 4, pp. 93-94, 150-165**

### Justice

Why do we care about justice (rather than alternative descriptions of how we ought to act)? Let's explore through popular framings of justice as what is fair as well as social justice (which includes environmental justice, data justice, design justice).

**Readings**:

- Eve Tuck & K. Wayne Yang (2016) "[What justice wants](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55807861e4b0847ced606181/t/583e3ed8f7e0ab6135358558/1480474329625/CES2.2+Tuck+and+Yang+What+Justice+Wants.pdf)" In *Critical Ethnic Studies*, *2*(2), 1-15 **focus on pp. 3-10, it will be dense!**

## Facilitation

Here are some guidelines about preparation in order to facilitate a session:

- Before the session:
  - Have read and thought about the texts
  - Identify and write 2-4 "themes" or questions you are interested in from the readings
  - We use the same [shared notepad](https://hackmd.io/oEcuKALCTi-PbawLmT_Ixw#): https://hackmd.io/oEcuKALCTi-PbawLmT_Ixw#, which has a template for notes
- During the session:
  - Arrive on time (call should auto record as the first person enters)
  - Ensure the call is recorded (it should auto-record as the first person enters, but always make sure someone presses the record button if not)
  - Ask for someone to take notes
  - Keep time and gently wrap us up
- After the session:
  - Copy the notes and open a pull request in [this repository](https://github.com/datatogether/reading_datatogether/tree/master/notes)

## Potential Readings

We maintain a shared bibliography in the [`datatogether` Zotero group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2250068/datatogether), which includes potential readings. 

Anyone can request an invite on a call or by [creating a github issue](https://github.com/datatogether/reading_datatogether/issues/new) in this repository with their Zotero username.
