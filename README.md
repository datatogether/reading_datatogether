We want to understand better just what it is that we're doing! The goal of this "syllabus" is to identify some key themes that drive Data Together as a project & as a politics, and to find some readings that help us understand those themes better.

Once a month on **Tuesday afternoon** we'll host a 1.5 hour discussion of one of [six themes](#themes) over summer 2018. Everyone should try hard to read the *core* reading (~30 pages), and once or twice sign up to facilitate discussion.

From this initial iteration, our hope is that the following outcomes occur: first, we learn together! second, through documenting the discussion we understand Data Together principles and see opportunities to feed into ongoing other initiatives and projects

## Sessions

### A view on the decentralized (distributed) web

Just getting us all on the same page about this very, err... central question, and also working through distinctions between similar terms (especially) decentralized, distributed, federated, p2p.

**Readings**:

- Brewster Kahle (2015) ["Locking the Web Open, a Call for a Distributed Web"](http://brewster.kahle.org/2015/04/22/locking-the-web-open-a-call-for-a-distributed-web/)

### Ownership

Sometimes when we talk about Data Together we use phrases like "communities taking ownership of their data". What do we mean, and why is this language important to us?

How should we think about "ownership" as a value, and in what ways are individual and collective ownership different from each other?

**Readings**:

### Commons

Sometimes, instead of ownership, we talk about a "commons". How ought the commons to be governed, and by whom?

### Privacy

Lately we've been hearing some interesting critiques of "privacy as a concept and moral imperative". Let's see if we think they hame sense.

**Readings**:

### Justice

What is right matters, why go to justice (rather than...), what is fair is discernable (there is something wrong) (Social Justice, Environmental Justice, Data Justice, Design Justice)

**Readings**:

- [Digital Justice](http://detroitdjc.org/principles/), [Design Justice](http://designjusticenetwork.org/network-principles/) principles

## Facilitation

Here are some guidelines about preparation in order to facilitate a session:

- Before the session: 
  - Have read and thought about the texts
  - Identify and write 2-4 "themes" or questions you are interested in from the readings
  - We use the same [shared notepad](https://hackmd.io/oEcuKALCTi-PbawLmT_Ixw#): https://hackmd.io/oEcuKALCTi-PbawLmT_Ixw#, which has a template for notes
- During the session:
  - Arrive on time (call should auto record as the first person enters)
  - Ensure the call is recorded (it should auto-record as the first person enters, but always make sure someone presses the record button if not)
  - Ask for someone to take notes
  - Keep time and gently wrap us up 
- After the session:
  - Copy the notes and open a pull request in [this repository](https://github.com/datatogether/reading_datatogether/tree/master/notes)
