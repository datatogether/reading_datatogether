Data. Together. Let's read about it
====

We want to understand better just what it is that we're doing! The goal of this "syllabus" is to identify some key themes that drive Data Together as a project & as a politics, and to find some readings that help us understand those themes better.

Once a month on **Tuesday afternoon** we'll host a 1.5 hour discussion of one themes over summer 2018. Everyone should try hard to read the *core* reading (~30 pages), and once or twice sign up to facilitate discussion.

📅 15:30-17:00 ET Tuesdays [**Data Together Calendar**](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=u75o4fbnv59006peo07nv67vsg%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FToronto)

# Sessions

## A view on the decentralized (distributed) web

Just getting us all on the same page about this very, err... central question, and also working through distinctions between similar terms (especially) decentralized, distributed, federated, p2p.

**Readings**:

- Brewster Kahle: [Locking the Web Open, a Call for a Distributed Web](http://brewster.kahle.org/2015/04/22/locking-the-web-open-a-call-for-a-distributed-web/) (2015)

## Ownership (July 24)

Sometimes when we talk about DT we use phrases like "communities taking ownership of their data". What do we mean, and why is this language important to us? How should we think about "ownership" as a value, and in what ways are individual and collective ownership different from each other?

- Something from 'Ours to hack and ours to own' Scholz
    - HOW PLATFORM COOPERATIVISM CAN UNLEASH THE NETWORK - TREBOR SCHOLZ (Clearest overview)
    - [COUNTERANTI- DISINTERMEDIATION](http://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Counter-Anti-Disintermediation) -  DMYTRI KLEINER?
    - THE MEANINGS OF WORDS - NATHAN SCHNEIDER? (focused on democracy)
- [Albrechtslund. "Negotiating ownership and agency in social media: Community reactions to Amazon's acquisition of GoodReads"](http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/7095/6161)


## Commons (August 21)

Sometimes, instead of ownership, we talk about a "commons". How ought the commons to be governed, and by whom?

- Ostrom, _Governing the Commons_ Chapter 1 and/or Chapter 2
- Linebaugh, "Enclosures from the Bottom Up,"_Stop, Thief!_ Chapter 9
- De Filippi, P., & Tréguer, F. (2015). Expanding the Internet commons: The subversive potential of wireless community networks.

## Centralization vs. Decentralization (and Peer-to-peer, Federation) (September 4)

- [Beyond distributed and decentralized: what is a federated network? Networked Cultures](networkcultures.org/unlikeus/resources/articles/what-is-a-federated-network/)
- [Defending Internet Freedom through Decentralization: Back to the Future?](http://dci.mit.edu/assets/papers/decentralized_web.pdf)
- [Helmond. The platformization of the web. (2015)](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2056305115603080)

## Privacy (September 25)

Lately we've been hearing some interesting critiques of "privacy as a concept and moral imperative". Let's see if we think they hame sense.

- [Lepore, Jill Privacy in an Age of Publicity](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/06/24/the-prism)
- Wendy Chun Talk, Right to Loiter [Mumbai women assert their right to loiter](http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/Mumbai-women-assert-their-right-to-loiter/article16898193.ece)

## Justice (October 30)

What is right matters, why go to justice (rather than...), what is fair is discernable (there is something wrong) (Social Justice, Environmental Justice, Data Justice, Design Justice)

- [Digital Justice](http://detroitdjc.org/principles/), [Design Justice](http://designjusticenetwork.org/network-principles/) principles
- Public Lab [Re-imagining the Data Lifecycle](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/07-01-2014/reimagining-the-data-lifecycle)
- Data Together Geo Article (?)
